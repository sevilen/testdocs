WUD supports many registries:
- [ACR (Azure Container Registry)](configuration/registries/acr/)
- [ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry)](configuration/registries/ecr/)
- [GCR (Google Container Registry)](configuration/registries/gcr/)
- [HUB (Docker Hub incl private repositories)](configuration/registries/hub/)

!> By default, WUD is working _out-of-the-box_ with public images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
