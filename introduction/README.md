## What is that?
**What's up Docker** (aka _**WUD**_) gets you notified when a new version of your Docker Container is available.  

WUD is built on top of 3 concepts:
- **WATCHERS** query your Docker hosts to get the containers to watch
- **REGISTRIES** check whether updates are available
- **TRIGGERS** get you notified upon available updates
